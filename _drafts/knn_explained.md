Democracy KNN America

De Tocqueville pun aside, KNN is an intuitive Machine Learning classifcation algorithm. This post will introduce the concepts behind KNN and display an implementation of KNN with Python and Numpy 



Conceptually KNN is pretty simple, and most of the hard work is done for us. 

1. You set K, which will be how many "neighbors" you count (who gets to vote)
2. Have a set of pre classified data
3. Introduce a new unclassified data point. 
4. The data point is classifed by having the K-Nearest Neighbors "vote" on the classification of the new data point. Typically you measure which neighbors are nearest based on Euclidean distance. 
5. Another step
