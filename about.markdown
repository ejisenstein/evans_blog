Evan James Isenstein attended [Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/) graduating in 2017. 

He was fascinated with the rapid growth of online learning and its potential to democratize education. He worked for [eCornell](https://www.ecornell.com/), Cornell's online learning program for two years. He worked as a Leads Qualifier, connecting with potential students and advising them on the best online course for them.

While at eCornell he completed certificates in Data Analytics and Project Management, he also implemented a system to track individual employee contributions to enrollments using Salesforce data and Excel. I then enrolled in the Data Science bootcamp [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAmL-ABhDFARIsAKywVafehItCX9Rx_Is6KMJpeVt2ROxlH3AaO5GLvlvLZwEonYzfLxjUQawaAhwrEALw_wcB) where I completed five data science projects as part of my curriculum.

Afterwards I completed a Insights Analyst Fellowship at [Team Whistle](https://teamwhistle.com/) where I automated the Tableau Dashboard for our Snap Analytics shows, I created a wordcloud generator to analyze YouTube comments for our shows and for competitor analysis, and I presented a regression analysis on the Snap show 'Whistle Worthy' to our production team. Then I worked as a Sales Engineer for a short-term position for [TeamMate Technology](https://www.teammatetechnology.com/) . While at TeamMate my responsibilities included but were not limited to the transition of our Project Management style into Fibonacci Scrum, updating our documentation in Jira, and demoing the product.
