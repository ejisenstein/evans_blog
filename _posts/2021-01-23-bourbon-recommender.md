title: "Bourbon Recommender" 
---

You shouldn't judge a bourbon by its bottle. But that begs the question, how should you judge a bourbon, or buy one? 

This bourbon recommender is geared towards users of the site [Breaking Bourbon](https://www.breakingbourbon.com/). This does not encompass every single bourbon ever created and it obviously does not encompass whiskeys that aren't bourbon.


While you can expect updates to the complexity of the bourbon recommender. There are currently two modes. The first is a Euclidean distance model. All bourbons are rated by the experts on five different charactersistics (Nose, Palate, Finish, Uniqueness, and Value) plus an overall rating. 

The next model is a NLP based model, utilzings TFIDF and Cosine Distance

There will be additional updates.
